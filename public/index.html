 <h1>Favourite Movies of Akshar</h1>
 <h2>My Top Three Mobies</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Memories Of Murder</h3>
 <p>A Korean movie which is so well directed and so local to korean that it is very immersive. This movie highlights that a murderer can not be known by looking at a face and that there are many such people lurking even among our own group.</p>
 <h3>Dead Poets Society</h3>
 <p>THis movies just made me cry a lot.</p>
 <h3>Dark Knight</h3>
 <p>A wonderfully well directed movie which showcases brilliant acting, action and VFX.</p>
